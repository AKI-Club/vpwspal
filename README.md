# VPW Studio stand-along palette tools
Some quickly-hacked together tools for converting JASC Paint Shop Pro palette
format to the VPW Studio `.vpwspal` format.

- `vpwspalconv` converts a single palette at a time.
- `vpwspalmerge` merges up to 16 4bpp (16 color) palettes into a single `.vpwspal` as sub-palettes.

For `vpwspalmerge`, the output filename is chosen from the first filename passed into
the program.
